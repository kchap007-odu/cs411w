Repository for CS411W Ener-G View project code

# Project Description

Ener-G View aims to provide customers with insights into their monthly utility bills
through analysis of trends in billing data as well as data available from smart device endpoints.
The overall product will integrate available data into a database associated with a user account.
Back-end algorithms will analyze the data and generate reports and suggestions, titled “Bright Ideas”
based on the analysis performed by the algorithms. The overall product will perform analysis and
integration across the domain of all supported consumption metadata (i.e., bills and smart devices),
however, this prototype will focus on the smart device emulation and relevant consumption and
analysis algorithms.
